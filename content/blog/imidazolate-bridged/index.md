## Abstract
Four types of non-substituted imidazolate-bridged copper(II) complexes using tris(1-pyrazolyl)methane (pz3CH) as a capping ligand were prepared. The study revealed variations in their crystal structures and magnetic properties, influenced by the different counter anions used.

## Introduction
The article discusses the role of non-substituted imidazole as a building block in the development of metalâ€“organic frameworks and explores diverse structural and magnetic interactions in copper(II) complexes.

## Graphical Abstract
The complexes [Cu(Î¼-im)(pz3CH)]nXn (with different counter anions) show equally-spaced polymeric chains, with strong exchange couplings influenced by the counter anion's nature.
