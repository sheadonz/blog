# Structures and Magnetic Properties of Transition Metal Complexes Involving 2,2â€™-bipyridin-6-yl Nitroxide

**Authors:** Akihiro Ondo, Takayuki Ishida  
**Published in:** AIP Conference Proceedings, Volume 1807, Issue 1, 2017

## Abstract
This research presents the synthesis and analysis of new complexes doubly chelated with two paramagnetic ligands, targeting the investigation of their structures and magnetic properties. The study employs X-ray crystallographic and magnetic measurements to explore antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions in these complexes.
